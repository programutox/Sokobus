# Sokobus
A Sokoban game with a level editor.

## Goal
You have to push the crates to their objectives.
For the moment, there are 20 levels, but you can add more using the editor!

## Why I made this game
When I started programming, I was reading Openclassrooms courses, and there was a practical work that consisted of creating a Sokoban game.

## Dependencies
I used [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp). \
Since raylib uses by default static linking, you don't need to install anyhing to launch the game, whether you are on Windows or Linux.
